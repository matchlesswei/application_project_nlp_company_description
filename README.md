# application_project_nlp_company_description
Analyse the start-up company product category according to their website text

All the code and the documents about this project are in the following folders. For the code, we used jupyter notebook to present and run the code, and we wrote and integrated the explanation for each part of code using markdown in the notebook.
Please notice, that some big files, like the original json files and the classified industry dta files are missing in this folder. So when running the relevant code, the directory of these files needs to be changed. Besides, Google Word2Vec pretrained model can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit.
